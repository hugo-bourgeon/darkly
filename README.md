42 project - introduction to web security 

## 📑 Introduction

In collaboration with [bcarolle (Ezuker)](https://github.com/Ezuker) and [hubourge (hugo-bourgeon)](https://github.com/hugo-bourgeon)  

The **Darkly** project is a **cybersecurity challenge** where you need to identify and exploit vulnerabilities on a vulnerable website. The goal is to find **14 different vulnerabilities**, such as **SQL injections**, **XSS flaws**, or **session-related vulnerabilities**.💻🔍

This project helps you learn **pentesting techniques**, understand the mechanisms behind **web vulnerabilities**, and develop key skills in cybersecurity.🚀🔐

## 🌱 Environment

The **Darkly** project is conducted in a controlled and **isolated environment** to ensure security while testing vulnerabilities. The website is hosted on a **local server**, running on a **virtual machine** (i386) with a provided ISO.

All attacks are performed **ethically** on the provided target, following **responsible disclosure principles**. 🛡️📜
